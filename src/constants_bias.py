For example, if the people cluster is "a teacher", and the corresponding element in the list is "a male black teacher in Infancy", the added content "Infancy" is unreasonable for the occupation "teacher". Therefore, it should be replaced with "in middle age" or other reasonable terms during integration.

As for race, you can use 'White', 'Black', 'Latino-Hispanic', 'Asian', 'MiddleEastern'. As for age, you must use 'Infancy', 'Childhood', 'Adolescence', 'Young Adulthood', 'Middle Age', 'Old Age' and you must use 'in + age' to describe the age.
